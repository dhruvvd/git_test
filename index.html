                    <p>
                        Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a 
                        <strong>cartilaginous skeleton</strong>, five to seven <strong>gill slits</strong> 
                        on the sides of the head, and <strong>pectoral fins</strong> that are not fused to the head.
                        Modern sharks are classified within the clade <em>Selachimorpha</em> and are the
                        sister group to the <em>Batoidea</em>.

                        There are more than <em>500</em> species of sharks swimming
                        in the oceans today, which are split across eight orders: 
                        Carcharhiniformes; Hederodotiformes; Hexanchiformes; Lamniformes;
                        Orectolobiformes; Pristiophoriformes; Squaliformes; and Squatiniformes.

                    <p>
                            Sharks inhabit all five of the world's oceans - <em>Atlantic,
                            Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern</em> - and are found
                            in shallow coastal waters to the deepest, darkest and coldest
                            parts of the open seas. They are common down to depths of
                            around 2000m but it is incredibly <strong>rare</strong> find sharks
                            below 3000m.

            <h2>Features</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Eyes</h3>
                        <p>
                            By all accounts, sharks have pretty impressive eyesight.
                            As a matter of fact, it is estimated that shark sight is
                            about <em>10 times better</em> than what humans have
                            in clear water. The <strong>structure</strong> of shark
                            eyes is very similar to that of human eyes, comprising of
                            a cornea, lens, retina, iris and pupil.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Fins</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>most recognized</strong> part of a shark is the 
                            <em>dorsal fin</em>, often seen neatly slicing the
                            surface of the water. Sharks also have a <em>caudal fin</em>,
                            an <em>anal fin</em>, a <strong>second</strong> dorsal fin, a
                            pair of <em>pectoral fins</em>, and a pair of <em>pelvic fins</em>.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Skin</h3>
                        <p>
                            Shark skin is overed by tiny, flat, V-shaped scales, called
                            dermal denticles, that are more like <strong>teeth</strong> than 
                            <strong>fish</strong> scales.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Jaw</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each jaw is somewhat flexible, consisting of right and
                            left halves <strong>joined</strong> in the center at what is
                            termed the <em>symphysis</em>. During a bite, many sharks
                            can extend the entire jaw structure <strong>forward</strong>,
                            thrusting it out from the skull. This helps some sharks
                            bite off parts of prey that are too big to swallow <strong>whole</strong>.
